Project explores SHG membership and decision-making independence of young girls in rural India. 
Abstract:
This paper explores how decision-making independence impacts the membership of Young Women Self Help Groups (YWSHGs), a popular and effective poverty alleviation measure in Uttar Pradesh, India. Adapting Houtenville and Conwayâ€™s 2008 theoretical model, I illustrate how increased independence of adolescent women in matters of their education, marriage, employment, and finances may lead to higher membership probability and lower socioeconomic barriers to membership. Empirically, using a dataset of 872 adolescent and young women aged 15-21 surveyed in rural Uttar Pradesh, I find 1) SHG membership has tangible financial benefits for higher-educated young women, 2) membership probability increases for General caste young women, and 3) membership probability increases even more for General caste members among non-independent young women. I suggest reducing household interference in the life decisions of adolescent women in the region, through updating legal structures, social policies, and educational efforts. These recommendations are aimed at enabling young and adolescent women to partake in Self Help Groups, with their associated benefits, at higher rates.
